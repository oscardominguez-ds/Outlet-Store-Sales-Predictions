## Model
- Linear Regression Model
- Decision Tree Regressor Model

### Model Training R2: 0.5598659623940478
### Model Test R2: 0.5616802564782515

The Random Forrest Model R2 score tells us that the features used in the model together account for 56 % of the variance in the target.

## Recommendations:
I recommend the Linear regression model. The errors or the difference from the true median price vs predicted is smaller than the Decision Tree model.
